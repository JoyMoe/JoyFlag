# JoyFlag

Flag icon by JoyMoe
A collection of all country flags in SVG (Circle).

## Usage

For using the flags inline with text add the classes `.joyflag` and
`.joyflag-xx` (where `xx` is the
[ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 code](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/)
of a country) to an empty `<i>`.
For example:

```html
<i class="joyflag joyflag-cn"></i>
```

You could also apply this to any element, but in that case you'll have to use the
`joyflag-background` instead of `joyflag` and you're set. This will add the
correct background with the following CSS properties:

```css
background-size: contain;
background-position: 50%;
background-repeat: no-repeat;
```
## Credits

The project was launched by the JoyMoe Inc. Open source project department
and the icons were collected on the internet or made by JoyMoe Inc.
